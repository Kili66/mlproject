## Introduction
The performance of students in academic settings can be influenced by various factors such as demographics, socioeconomic status, study habits, and previous academic achievements. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to build a predictive model that can estimate the academic performance of students.

Predicting student performance can have several practical applications, including identifying students who may be at risk of failing or dropping out, providing personalized educational interventions, and optimizing resource allocation in educational institutions.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams and it contains information about students, including their demographics, family background, study habits, and academic performance. It is a well-structured dataset with a large number of samples, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in this project: 

Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating predictive models.
pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment used for prototyping and development.
Visual Code: all the .py codes are executed there inside our environment created

## Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Kili66/mlproject.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd student-performance-prediction
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
Open the student_performance_prediction.ipynb file and execute the code cells to explore the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Note: Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.

## Model Training
The project explores various machine learning algorithms to predict student performance. These algorithms include
-Linear Regression
-Regularization: Ridge and Lasso
-decision trees
random forests Regressor
- KNN,
- boosting classifiers
-  The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling if required.
## Evaluation
The performance of the trained models is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as MSE, MAE, r2 square, RMSE
